						<p>Kim came to America when she was 12 and since then has lived in 5 different cities across the country from California to Florida before calling Houston home 10 years ago.</p>
						<p>Kim first encountered the real estate industry working as a marketing specialist for a local brokerage. She was later promoted to listing coordinator and property manager where she managed multiple single home properties. Through these roles, she developed her passion for property management and real estate.</p>
						<p>Kim attended University of Houston where she obtained her Bachelor’s Degree in Advertising with a minor in Global Business. A semester prior to graduation, she had the privilege to be a leasing agent for one of the top management companies in the nation. Her hard work and dedication allowed her to be promoted as the Assistant Manager for a Houston Heights property after a short 4 months In addition to her education and real estate experience, Kim has also obtained experience in the Oil and Gas field. Houston being an energy market, Kim found that her exposure to this industry has helped her to better understand and connect with potential clients.</p>
						<p>In her free time, she’s either working on art projects, exploring the city or attending cultural events. She also enjoys volunteering and traveling. Being a realtor is more than a job, it is doing what Kim loves and the relationships she builds with her clients along the way.</p>
